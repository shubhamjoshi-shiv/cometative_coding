    "Maximize Sum\n",

    "\n",
    "Initialise a 2-D ‘dp’ list (array) for keeping track of the maximised sums calculated for each element ‘i’.\n",
    "For each array element ‘i’, dp[i][0] would keep track of the maximised sum possible without swapping the ‘i’th elements between the two lists (arrays) while dp[i][1] would keep track of the maximised sum possible after swapping the ‘i’th elements of the lists (arrays).\n",
    "In every iteration the dp[i][0] and dp[i][1] can be calculated in the following manner:-\n",
    "dp[i][0] = abs(arr1[i] - arr2[i]) + max(dp[i-1][0] + abs(arr1[i] - arr2[i-1]), dp[i-1][1] + abs(arr1[i] - arr1[i-1]))\n",
